The project presents the development of an 
automated orange fruit counting system using shape descriptors 
and machine learning algorithms. The paper aims to address the 
need for efficient and accurate fruit counting methods in the 
agricultural industry. The system utilizes computer vision 
techniques to analyze images of orange fruits and employs shape 
descriptors, namely HOG and SIFT, to extract relevant 
features. These features are then used as inputs for machine 
learning algorithms, including SVM, KNN, and K-means, to 
classify and count the orange fruits. The paper involves a 
comprehensive experimental setup, implementation of the 
proposed system, and evaluation of its performance using a 
dataset of orange fruit images. The results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the automated counting system of two best 
models with an accuracy of 100% and 75% respectively, 
quantifying orange fruits and provide insights for potential 
applications in crop management.
